The subarctic climate is monsoonal (i.e., there is seasonal variation in rainfall) and is characterized by large seasonal temperature variations. The coldest month has an average temperature below 0°C, and only 1 to 3 months of the year have an average temperature above 10°C. Precipitation is unevenly distributed, with wet monsoon summers and very dry winters. The rainiest summer month has at least 10 times more rainfall than the driest winter month.
