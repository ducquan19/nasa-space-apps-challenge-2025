A humid subtropical climate is a climate characterized by hot, humid summers and cool to mild winters. It occurs in the southeast of continents (except Antarctica), mainly between latitudes 25° and 40°, and is poleward of the adjacent tropical climates. In some other classification systems, this climate is also called a warm temperate climate.

The Cfa climate type has a coldest month average temperature between 0°C and below 18°C and a hottest month average temperature of 22°C or above. Winters here are not cold enough to freeze the ground or have continuous snow cover lasting more than a month.

Although many humid subtropical regions are located near the coast, some humid subtropical climates extend further inland. Here, seasonal variations are more pronounced, with a large difference between summer and winter that acts as a transition zone between the hot tropical climate in the south and the cold continental climate in the north. Therefore, the characteristics of humid subtropical climates can vary somewhat depending on geographical location, for example, coastal areas will have milder temperatures due to the moderating influence of the ocean, while inland areas may be more severe.

In summer, this climate is often characterized by long periods of high temperatures and high humidity. Average summer temperatures are typically between 24 and 27°C and daytime highs can range from the late 20s to mid-30s. Evening lows are typically around 20°C. Summer is also strongly influenced by tropical air currents, causing thunderstorms to occur frequently in the evening, which are usually brief but intense.

In winter, temperatures are generally mild, with monthly averages ranging from 7.5 to 16°C. During the day, high temperatures typically range from 10 to 16°C, while at night they can range from 2 to 7°C. However, at the northernmost edge of this climate, cold spells can occur, with temperatures dropping below 0°C.

Rainfall in humid subtropical climates tends to increase sharply in summer, especially in areas with strong monsoon influences such as Southeast Asia and South Asia – this is a characteristic of the Cwa climate type (humid subtropical with dry winters). In other areas, rainfall may be evenly distributed throughout the year, but there is no distinct dry summer as in Mediterranean climates (Csa).

Most summer rainfall comes from convective thunderstorms that form due to intense heating of the ground surface by the high angle of the subtropical sun. In addition, weak tropical cyclones or low pressure systems moving in from the adjacent tropical ocean also contribute to summer rainfall. Meanwhile, winter rainfall is often associated with large-scale cyclones from the westerly wind zone, bringing cold fronts down to the subtropical latitudes.
