Subpolar maritime climate (Cfc) is a climate type that occurs in regions closer to the poles or at higher altitudes than temperate maritime climates, and is usually confined to narrow western coastal strips near the poles of continents, or on islands located off the coasts of such regions, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. This climate exists in both hemispheres, most commonly between 60° and 70° North and South latitudes.

Snowfall is common and frequent in these areas, but extreme weather is rare. Winters are long but relatively mild, while summers are cool and short, with average temperatures reaching 10°C or higher for one to three months. Compared to temperate maritime climates, summers are shorter and cooler, but winters are not as cold as those of continental subarctic climates further inland.
