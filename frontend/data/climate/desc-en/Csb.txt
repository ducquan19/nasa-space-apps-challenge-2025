Sometimes called a "cool summer Mediterranean climate", the Csb climate is a rarer subtype of the Mediterranean climate. This climate has warm but not hot and dry summers, with no month of the year having an average temperature exceeding 22 Â°C in the warmest month. The coolness of this climate is often due to the influence of cold ocean currents, upwelling, and its higher latitude.
