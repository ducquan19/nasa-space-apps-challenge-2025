Hot semi-arid climates typically occur between 20 and 30 degrees latitude, in the tropics and subtropics, often near areas with tropical savanna or humid subtropical climates. This type of climate has hot, even very hot summers, while winters are generally warm to cool. Annual rainfall is low or very low and often erratic. Hot semi-arid climates typically occur on the edges of subtropical deserts.
