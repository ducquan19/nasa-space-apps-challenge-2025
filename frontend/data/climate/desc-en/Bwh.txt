Hot desert climates typically occur below the subtropical high pressure zone, located at mid-low latitudes, typically between 20° and 33° North and South. In these areas, stable, dry air descends from above, along with high pressure, causing clouds to dissipate, creating hot, dry conditions.

In summer, when the Sun is high in the sky, the climate becomes extremely hot and dry, the average temperature in the hot months is usually between 29–35°C, the midday temperature often reaches 43–46°C is normal. The highest recorded temperature in the world sometimes exceeds 50°C, often recorded in hot deserts, especially those in the tropics where the heat potential is highest on Earth.

During the colder seasons of the year, due to clear skies and strong nighttime radiation, temperatures can drop to freezing or lower. However, in this climate type, temperatures are very rare to drop below 0°C, except in a few cold subtypes.
