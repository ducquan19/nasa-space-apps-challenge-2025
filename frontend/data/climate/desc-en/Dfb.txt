A humid continental climate is a climate characterized by four distinct seasons and large temperature variations between them, with warm to hot summers (often with high humidity) and cold winters (which can be severe in northern areas). Precipitation is generally evenly distributed throughout the year, but there may also be dry or low-rainfall seasons. This climate, also known as a subarctic climate, has an average hottest month temperature below 22°C. Summer daytime temperatures typically range from 21–28°C, while the average coldest month temperature is often well below −3°C. Frost-free periods typically last 3–5 months, and heatwaves lasting more than a week are rare. The warm summer area of a humid continental climate covers a much larger area than the hot summer area.
