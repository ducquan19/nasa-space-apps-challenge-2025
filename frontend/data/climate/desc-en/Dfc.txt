Subarctic climates (also called subpolar climates or north temperate climates) are characterized by long, often very cold winters and short, warm to cool summers. They typically occur on large continents, far from the moderating influence of the ocean, at latitudes between about 50° and 70°N, poleward of the humid continental climates. Subarctic climates are the source of cold air that affects southern temperate zones in winter.

In cold subarctic climates, the coldest month has an average temperature below −38°C, while 1 to 3 months have an average temperature above 10°C. There is no significant difference in rainfall between seasons, with summers being generally wetter, but total rainfall is very low.
