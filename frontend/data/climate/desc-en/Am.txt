A tropical monsoon climate (sometimes also called a monsoon climate or a trade wind coastal climate) is characterized by average monthly temperatures above 18°C ​​throughout the year and a distinct dry season. A tropical monsoon climate is considered an intermediate climate between a humid tropical climate (Af) and a tropical savanna climate (Aw), being wetter than Aw but drier than Af.

In a tropical monsoon climate, the driest month has an average rainfall of less than 60mm, which is in marked contrast to a tropical savanna climate where the driest month has much less than 60mm. In general, tropical monsoon climates have more rainfall than savanna climates and have less severe dry seasons. Soil moisture is generally sufficient to sustain tropical rainforests.

Additionally, temperatures in tropical monsoon climates vary less throughout the year than in savanna climates. The driest month usually coincides with or occurs just after the winter solstice, depending on the hemisphere. The term "monsoon" refers to the seasonal change in wind direction, associated with changes in rainfall.

There are two main variations of the tropical monsoon climate:

Dry season is not too distinct: In these areas, the rainy season has a lot of rain, often thunderstorms. In the dry season, there is also a lot of rain, not completely dry, in general, the difference between the seasons is not too distinct.

Extremely wet season and distinct dry season: This type has a dry season similar to a savanna climate, while the rainy season has very heavy and prolonged rains, which can reach or exceed 1000 mm/month, for two or more consecutive months.
