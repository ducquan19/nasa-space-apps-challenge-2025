Tropical savanna climate (As & Aw):

Tropical savanna climates, also known as tropical wet and dry climates, are divided into two groups, Aw (dry winter) and As (dry summer – a less common case) according to the Köppen climate classification system. The main characteristic of this climate type is that the driest month has less than 60 mm of rainfall and also less than a certain threshold based on the monthly average rainfall.

Unlike tropical monsoon climates, where rainfall in the driest month is less than 60 mm but still above this threshold, tropical savanna climates typically have less rainfall during the wet season than monsoon climates or have a longer and more pronounced dry season. The dry season usually lasts at least three months and total annual rainfall is usually between 1000 and 1500 mm.

During the dry season of a savanna climate, rainfall can be very low, with some months without any rain resulting in widespread drought, so the landscape is often characterized by open grasslands with scattered trees rather than dense forests. It is this characteristic of tall, rough grasslands called savannas that causes the Aw and As climates to be referred to collectively as tropical savanna climates. However, there is still debate about whether savanna grasslands are entirely climate-driven, and treeless savannas are rare.

The Aw climate is a dry winter climate, meaning the dry season coincides with the time when the sun is low in the sky and the days are shorter. The As climate, on the other hand, is a dry summer climate, meaning the dry season occurs when the sun is high in the sky and the days are longer, which is quite rare because the rainy season usually coincides with the time when the sun is at its highest. Basically, the difference between the two types Aw and As is sometimes very small, especially in places where there is no clear seasonal difference. Some areas with As climate may have a rain shadow effect that reduces rainfall in the summer.
