The Mediterranean-influenced subarctic and cold subarctic climate is a rare climate type that combines extremely cold winters with a Mediterranean-like dry summer rainfall pattern. In this climate type, the coldest month has an average temperature below −38°C, and only 1 to 3 months of the year have an average temperature above 10°C. Precipitation is strongly seasonal, with the wettest winter month having at least 3 times more precipitation than the driest summer month, and the driest summer month having less than 30 mm of precipitation.
