A cold subarctic climate influenced by monsoons (with seasonal differences in rainfall), characterized by very severe winters and short, warmer summers. In this climate, the coldest month has an average temperature below −38°C, and only 1 to 3 months of the year have an average temperature above 10°C. Precipitation is concentrated mainly in the summer due to the influence of the monsoon, with 70% or more of the annual rainfall falling in the six warmest months. Although rainfall is generally very low, evaporation is almost negligible due to the year-round low temperatures.
