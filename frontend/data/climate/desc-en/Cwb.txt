Subtropical highland climate is a type of climate often grouped with maritime climate and exists in some mountainous areas or highlands of the subtropical or tropical regions. Although located at different latitudes, the altitude of these areas makes the climate have characteristics similar to maritime climate.

The monsoon-influenced subtropical highland climate is characterized by wet summers and dry winters. In areas outside the tropics, apart from the tendency to be dry in winter, the subtropical highland climate is almost identical to the maritime climate, meaning mild summers and markedly cooler winters, with occasional snowfall. In the tropics, the subtropical highland climate is generally temperate year-round. Temperatures remain stable throughout the year and snow is rare due to the warmer winters than in most maritime climates.

Areas with this climate type typically have monthly mean temperatures below 22 °C, but not below 0 °C or −3 °C, depending on the isotherm standard used. At least one month of the year has an average temperature below 18 °C.
