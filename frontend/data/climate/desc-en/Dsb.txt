Winters in these climates are typically cold to very cold, with the coldest month's average temperature below 0 °C, and summers are warm with the hottest month's average temperature below 22 °C, but there are still at least 4 months with average temperatures above 10 °C.

Precipitation is typical of a Mediterranean climate: wet winters and dry summers. The wettest month in winter is usually at least three times the amount of rain in the driest summer month, and the driest summer month has less than 30 mm of rain. Winters can see winter storms that bring heavy snowfall, while summers have little convection, resulting in dry weather and little rain.
