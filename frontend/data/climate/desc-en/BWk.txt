Cold desert climates typically have hot or warm, dry summers, but are generally not as hot as hot desert climates (BWh). The distinct difference is that winters in cold deserts are usually very cold and dry, with snowfall being rare and erratic.

Cold deserts are generally located at higher altitudes and are also generally drier than hot deserts. They are common in temperate zones, especially in areas on the leeward side of high mountains, where the rain shadow effect prevents moisture from blowing in from the westerly winds.

Although the Arctic and Antarctic regions also have very low rainfall due to the extreme cold air freezing the moisture, these two regions are not classified as cold desert climates but belong to polar climates because the average summer temperature there is always below 10Â°C.
