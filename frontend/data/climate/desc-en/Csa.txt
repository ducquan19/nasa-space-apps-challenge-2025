Mediterranean climates are found in the western part of continents, between 30° and 45° latitude. In winter, these areas are under the influence of the polar trough, which results in mild temperatures with variable weather and frequent rain. Summers are hot and dry due to the influence of the subtropical high pressure system. However, in coastal areas near the ocean, summers tend to be cooler due to the nearby cold ocean current, which can create fog but prevents rain.

In summer, Mediterranean climates are strongly influenced by subtropical high pressure, making the atmosphere very dry and almost cloudless. In some places, cold ocean currents stabilize the surrounding air, reducing the chance of rain, but often cause dense fog in the morning, which usually dissipates by midday. Similar to desert climates, many Mediterranean climates also have large day-night temperature differences in summer due to hot days and rapidly falling temperatures at night.

In winter, subtropical high pressure systems move towards the equator, increasing the likelihood of rain. As a result, these climates receive almost all of their rainfall in winter and spring, while summer and early autumn can last four to six months with little to no significant rainfall. At lower latitudes, rainfall often decreases in both winter and summer due to high evapotranspiration. Closer to the poles, the overall humidity increases, and a steppe climate may prevail, but still follows the typical rainy winter, dry summer pattern of Mediterranean climates.

Additionally, the Csa climate temperature and rainfall pattern can also appear as microclimates in some highland areas near areas with rare As tropical climates, often located in rain shadow areas. These areas have a pleasant climate with mild, wet winters and relatively hot, dry summers.
