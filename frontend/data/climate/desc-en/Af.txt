Tropical climate is characterized by stable high temperature, the average temperature of the months of the year is usually 18°C ​​or more, annual rainfall is usually very high, reaching from 1800mm to 2500mm per year, the average monthly rainfall is at least 60mm, humidity is abundant all year round, almost unchanged. If considering the change in temperature and humidity, this type of climate is usually not clearly divided into seasons, there is no winter and frost, creating favorable conditions for tropical vegetation to grow strongly.

If the area is affected by low pressure systems formed by the presence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) for most of the year and there are no cyclones, the climate is classified as equatorial. Conversely, when the trade winds prevail for most of the year, the climate is considered to be a humid tropical climate due to the trade winds. The area affected by this climate usually ranges within about 10 geographical latitudes from the equator.
