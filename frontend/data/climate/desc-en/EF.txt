A glacial climate is a type of polar climate in which no month of the year has an average temperature above 0Â°C. This means that temperatures remain at freezing levels all year round, not allowing for complete melting of snow or ice at any point.

The most prominent feature of a glacial climate is the permanent ice cover that covers the area all year round, and there is absolutely no vegetation due to the harsh conditions. Precipitation is very low, mainly in the form of snow, but due to the lack of melting, snow and ice accumulate over thousands of years to form huge ice sheets and glaciers. This is one of the harshest and uninhabitable climates for humans as well as most living creatures.
