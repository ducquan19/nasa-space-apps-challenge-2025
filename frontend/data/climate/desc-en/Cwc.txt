Cold subtropical highland climates or subarctic maritime climates influenced by monsoons have summers that are colder than subtropical highland climates (Cwb) due to their higher elevations. The coldest month has an average temperature above 0°C, and only 1 to 3 months of the year have an average temperature above 10°C. Precipitation in the wettest month of summer is at least 10 times higher than in the driest month of winter (about 70% or more of the total average annual precipitation falls in the 6 warmest months of the year).

The cold, dry winter subtropical highland climate exists in the high mountain areas adjacent to the Cwb climate zones. This is a rare climate type, mainly distributed in isolated areas.
