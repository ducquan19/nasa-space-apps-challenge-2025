Tundra climate is a type of polar climate, usually found at high latitudes near the Arctic or at high altitudes in mountain ranges. The main characteristic of this type of climate is that no month has an average temperature exceeding 10 °C, but at least one month has an average temperature above 0 °C, enough to melt snow.

In a polar setting, winters are long and very cold, and summers are short and cool. Most precipitation falls as snow, and there is very little precipitation overall, due to the low water vapor pressure in cold air. Temperatures in the tundra are often very low, but can be slightly warmer in the summer, although not for long. Winters in a tundra climate are long, dark, and cold, with average temperatures below 0°C lasting 6 to 10 months a year. The temperatures are so low that the soil underneath is permanently frozen.

In addition to the polar tundra climate, there is another variant called alpine tundra, which is a tundra environment that occurs at high altitudes, often above the treeline. This climate is found in alpine grasslands and shrublands, which have similar characteristics to the polar tundra but are defined by elevation rather than latitude
