The Mediterranean-influenced hot-summer humid continental climate is a rare climate type that combines the characteristics of continental and Mediterranean climates, with a distinct and severe seasonal differentiation. This climate type has very cold winters, with the coldest month averaging below 0°C (or −3°C), while the summers are hot, with the hottest month averaging above 22°C and at least four months averaging above 10°C. Although classified as a humid continental climate, these areas have relatively low rainfall of only about 500 mm per year, so they can be considered sub-arid but not dry.

The most characteristic feature of the Dsa climate is dry summers and wet winters, similar to a Mediterranean climate. The rainfall in the wettest month in winter is at least three times that of the driest month in summer, and the driest month in summer has less than 30 mm of rainfall.
